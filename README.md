# Bootstrap Portfolio
This portfolio is almost identical to my first one, but is styled using CSS this time and looks a little nicer.

This is the Bootstrap version of my digital portfolio. I rewrote it in Bootstrap for easier accessability and responsiveness. I also improved how it looked since the previous version looked ugly  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
